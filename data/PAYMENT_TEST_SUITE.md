# Payment Processing Suite Test Generation Algorithm

> **STRICT EXECUTION REQUIRED:**
> All steps must be executed in order. No step may be skipped or merged.
> At every checkpoint, if the result is not as expected, follow the explicit branch.
> Every step and branch must be logged in `reports/test_results.xml` before proceeding.

## Test Generation Scope

Test Scope: `Stripe integration, PayPal integration, credit card processing, refund handling, error scenarios, transaction rollbacks, concurrent transactions, PCI compliance validation`
Test Framework: `pytest`
Test Types: `unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, security tests, concurrency tests`
Coverage Targets: `95% code coverage for all payment-related modules and critical transaction paths`

### **Step 1: Analysis & Planning**

**1.1** Analyze test requirements:

- Components to test
- Test types needed
- Coverage requirements
- Performance criteria

**1.2** Review existing tests:

- Current coverage
- Test patterns
- Known gaps
- Test quality

**1.3** Create test plan:

- Test hierarchy
- Test categories
- Mocking strategy
- Data requirements

---

### **Step 2: Environment Setup**

**2.1** Configure test environment:

- Install test framework
- Set up test runners
- Configure coverage tools
- Set up mocking framework

**2.2** Create test structure:

- Test directories
- Helper modules
- Fixtures
- Mock data

---

### **Step 3: Test Generation Loop**

_(Repeat for each component)_

**3.1** Generate unit tests:

- Function/method tests
- Class tests
- Edge cases
- Error scenarios

**3.2** Generate integration tests:

- Component interaction
- API contracts
- Data flow
- Error handling

**3.3** Generate end-to-end tests:

- User workflows
- System integration
- Performance scenarios

**3.4** Run test suite:

```bash
pytest --junitxml=reports/test_results.xml --cov=payment --cov-report=xml:reports/coverage.xml
```

- **If tests PASS:**

  - Run linter:

  ```bash
  flake8 payment/
  ```

  - If linter passes, continue to 3.5
  - If linter fails, fix and repeat 3.4

- **If tests FAIL:**
  - Debug failures
  - Fix test issues
  - Return to relevant test generation step

**3.5** Document in `reports/test_results.xml`:

- Tests added
- Coverage metrics
- Known limitations
- TODOs

---

### **Step 4: Coverage Analysis**

**4.1** Generate coverage report:

- Line coverage
- Branch coverage
- Function coverage
- Complexity coverage

**4.2** Compare with targets:

```
Required: 95% code coverage for all payment-related modules and critical transaction paths
```

**4.3** Document in `reports/coverage.xml`:

- Coverage metrics
- Uncovered areas
- Risk assessment
- Recommendations

- **If targets met:**

  - Continue to Step 5

- **If targets not met:**
  - Identify gaps
  - Return to Step 3 for missing coverage

---

### **Step 5: Test Quality Review**

**5.1** Review test quality:

- Test readability
- Maintainability
- Performance
- Reliability

**5.2** Verify test characteristics:

- Independence
- Repeatability
- Self-validation
- Timeliness
- Isolation

**5.3** Optimize test suite:

- Remove redundant tests
- Combine similar tests
- Improve test speed
- Enhance readability

---

### **Step 6: Documentation**

**6.1** Update test documentation in `docs/testing`:

- Test strategy
- Test patterns
- Setup instructions
- Maintenance guide

**6.2** Document in test files:

- Test purpose
- Test data
- Assumptions
- Known limitations

**6.3** Verify acceptance criteria:

```
All payment scenarios are covered, including success, failure, and rollback situations. PCI compliance checks are validated. All tests pass with at least 95% code coverage and zero critical or high security vulnerabilities detected.
```

---

## **Error Handling and Halts**

- At **any step**, if:

  - Test framework fails
  - Coverage tools error
  - System under test unavailable
  - Critical test failures

  **THEN:**

  - Log state in `reports/test_results.xml`
  - Document error conditions
  - Halt for review if needed
